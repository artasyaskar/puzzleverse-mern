instructions: >-

  tokens are invalidated. Preserve rotation behavior.
task_description: |
  Task: Enforce a max count of outstanding refresh tokens per user and trim the oldest.

  What must work (we will actually check these):
  - Multiple successful logins create distinct refresh tokens.
  - POST /api/auth/refresh invalidates the used token and returns a new one.
  - Enforce a cap (e.g., max 5 tokens per user). When exceeded, remove the oldest.
  - Attempting refresh with a trimmed (oldest) token returns 401.
  - Rotation via /refresh keeps the cap intact (no growth beyond the limit).
  - No refresh token appears in any response other than the field named refreshToken.

  Where to make your changes (paths you’ll likely touch):
  - server/src/auth/service.js — manage per-user token list, cap, and trimming.
  - server/src/index.js — no behavior change; expose if needed for testing.
  - server/src/utils/collections.js — optional helpers (e.g., bounded queues) if desired.

  Notes (not graded directly):
  - Keep everything in memory and avoid logging token values.
