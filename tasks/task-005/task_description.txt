task: JWT Claims and Secret Precedence
instructions: >-
  Ensure access tokens include standard claims and that the JWT secret is read
  from process.env.JWT_SECRET when provided. Add a small config header to the
  health endpoint.
task_description: |
  Task: Strengthen JWT claims and configuration semantics.

  What must work (we will actually check these):
  - Access token (JWT) includes: sub, email, iat, exp. HS256 algorithm.
  - exp should be in the near future (we won't wait; we only check it exists and is > now).
  - If JWT_SECRET env var is set, it must be used; otherwise fall back to a safe default.
  - /api/health response must include header X-App-Name with a non-empty value.
  - /api/me must reject a token with a clearly expired exp (we will simulate an expired token).
  - /api/me must reject a token signed with the wrong secret.

  Where to make your changes (paths you’ll likely touch):
  - server/src/auth/service.js — token signing (claims, algorithm, verification) and secret precedence.
  - server/src/index.js — set X-App-Name header on health.
  - server/src/config.js — export APP_NAME and read JWT secret precedence if needed.

  Notes (not graded directly):
  - Keep HS256 throughout and do not leak secrets.
