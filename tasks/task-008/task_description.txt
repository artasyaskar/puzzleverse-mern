task: Check out /api/me for extra details - also notice the response headers it returns
instructions: >-
  Expand the /api/me output to show steady details alongside a straightforward reply
  Use clear titles. Make sure answers protect private details.
task_description: |
  Update the /api/me spot with extra details, also use logical headers. Each piece fits together without clutter - keep it clean, nothing fancy.

  What needs to work - since we’re checking it on our own:
  - The endpoint /api/me returns a JSON containing: id (string), email (string), createdAt (in date-time format).
  The response must skip passwords; also leave out passwordHash.
  - /api/me responses include Cache-Control: no-store plus set Content-Type: application/json.
  - Same token, repeated calls - results stay the same; details such as id or email don't shift no matter how often you try.
  - No valid token? You get a 401 response along with a JSON alert showing the error detail
  Content-Type: application/json.
  The health check keeps working like before, giving back status ok.

  This is where you tweak stuff - spots that could use a shift
  - server/src/auth/service.js – verify createdAt gets stored right, also shows up when setting up auth.
  - server/src/index.js – checks some stuff before setting no-store or json headers on /api/me replies.
  - server/src/utils/http.js – handy tools for managing headers, while taking care of typed JSON output.

  Tips - these won't change your result.
  Leave out private details from the /api/me response.
