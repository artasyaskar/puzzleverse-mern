instructions: >-
  Extend the /api/me response to include stable fields and appropriate response
  headers. Keep the response privacy-preserving.
task_description: |
  Task: Enrich the /api/me endpoint and set sensible headers.

  What must work (we will actually check these):
  - /api/me returns a JSON body with: id (string), email (string), createdAt (ISO string).
  - The response must not include password or passwordHash.
  - /api/me responses include Cache-Control: no-store and Content-Type: application/json.
  - Multiple calls with the same token return the same values (id/email/createdAt stable).
  - Missing or invalid token returns 401 (JSON with an error message).
  - Health endpoint must still work and not be affected by these changes.

  Where to make your changes (paths you’ll likely touch):
  - server/src/auth/service.js — ensure createdAt is tracked and available in auth context.
  - server/src/index.js — set headers (no-store/json) on /api/me responses.
  - server/src/utils/http.js — optional helpers for headers and typed JSON responses.

  Notes (not graded directly):
  - Do not include any internal fields in the /api/me payload.
