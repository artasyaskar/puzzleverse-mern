  Task: Wire CORS and Security Headers for the server.

  What must work (we will actually check these):
  - CORS
    - GET /api/health has Access-Control-Allow-Origin header (default '*').
    - POST /api/auth/register also has the header.
    - OPTIONS preflight to /api/auth/register responds 204 with proper CORS headers.
    - Vary: Origin is present on CORS responses.
  - Security headers
    - X-Content-Type-Options=nosniff
    - X-Frame-Options=SAMEORIGIN
    - X-XSS-Protection=0

  Where to make your changes (paths you’ll likely touch):
  - server/src/index.js — mount CORS and security headers middleware.
  - server/src/middleware/cors.js — ensure headers are set for GET/POST/OPTIONS.
  - server/src/config.js — optional: origin allowlist (may be extended later).

  Notes (not graded directly):
  - You can allow all origins by default. Credentials are not required.
