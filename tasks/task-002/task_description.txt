task: Wire CORS and Security Headers
instructions: >-
  Add proper CORS along with key security headers into the Express config. Focus on
  the items displayed in "What must work" just here. Keep it straightforward with simple terms.
task_description: |
  Turn on CORS plus add safety headers in the server setup.

  What needs to work - since we’ll actually try it out:
  - CORS
  - The endpoint GET /api/health sends back the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header - set to blank unless changed.
  The POST endpoint at /api/auth/register sends along the header as well.
  The OPTIONS call to /api/auth/register returns 204 plus proper CORS headers.
  Origin appears in CORS responses.
  - Security headers
  - X-Content-Type-Options=nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options=SAMEORIGIN
  - X-XSS-Protection=0

  Here's the spot to change things - places you might adjust:
  - server/src/index.js – configured CORS plus added security headers through middleware.
  - server/src/middleware/cors.js – check that headers behave right whether you're sending a GET, POST, or OPTIONS request.
  - server/src/config.js – your call: origins permitted (might expand later) but feel free to adjust anytime.

  Opinions? They won’t boost your result
  You can allow each source instantly - no sign-in details required at all.
