task: Robust Input Validation with Helpful 400s
instructions: >-
  Tighten login checks - messy tries now get a clean 400 error instead
  basic ideas you could try without hassle – take a peek at whatever appears just below now.
task_description: |
  Look over inputs closely at /api/auth/register - also peek into /api/auth/login. If something breaks, drop clear hints right away (error 400).

  What needs to work - since we're actually giving it a shot
  - /api/auth/register validation
  If the email's gone, you'll see a 400 error - yet 'email' appears somewhere within it.
  If there’s no password set, you’ll get a 400 error - screen shows “password.”.
  - Incorrect email settings trigger a 400 error, plus the word "email" shows up in the alert.
  If the password’s way too short, you get a 400 error - no big deal, just small hints like someone tossing out ‘8’ randomly or casual remarks on length.
  Passwords must have letters along with numbers - skip one, get a 400 error saying 'letter missing' or 'number required'. Leave out both? The response pops right away, calling out the mistake clear as day.
  - /api/auth/login validation
  If the email isn't there, you'll see a 400 error - pointing straight at "email" as the issue.
  - If no password’s given, it responds with a 400 - points straight to the missing "password." .
  - Privacy
  Error messages must skip anything labeled password or passwordHash - just don't include them at all.

  Play around with things here - places where changes might work better
  - server/src/auth/routes.js – look into specifics; if not right, return 400 with straight clues fast.
  - server/src/utils/validators.js – a set of helpers that look at email format, check minimum length, or spot if letters mix with digits.
  - server/src/utils/http.js – useful helpers to send common 400 errors, depending on the situation, switching up methods as required.

  Remember - these won’t change how things turn out
  - Give short alerts that are easy to get; skip any personal info entirely.
