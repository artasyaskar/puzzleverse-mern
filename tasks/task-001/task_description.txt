Task: Implement Task API Endpoints

Instructions:
You are tasked with implementing the task management API endpoints in the backend. The current implementation contains placeholder functions that need to be replaced with actual database operations using Mongoose.

Background:
The application is a task management system where users can create, read, update, and delete tasks. The frontend expects specific responses from these endpoints.

Requirements:
1. Implement the following endpoints in taskController.js:
   - GET /api/tasks - Should return all tasks from the database
   - POST /api/tasks - Should create a new task with title and description
   - PUT /api/tasks/:id - Should update an existing task
   - DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Should delete a task

2. The Task model has the following schema:
   - title: String (required)
   - description: String
   - status: String (enum: 'pending', 'in-progress', 'completed')
   - createdAt: Date
   - updatedAt: Date

3. Error Handling:
   - Return 404 if task not found
   - Return 400 for invalid input
   - Return 500 for server errors

4. Success Responses:
   - GET: 200 with array of tasks
   - POST: 201 with created task
   - PUT: 200 with updated task
   - DELETE: 200 with deleted task ID
