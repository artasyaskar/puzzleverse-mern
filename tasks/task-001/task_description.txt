Task: Implement User Authentication System

Instructions:
Implement a complete user authentication system for the PuzzleVerse application. The system should include user registration, login, and protected routes. The implementation must include both frontend and backend components.

Background:
User authentication is a critical component of most web applications. This task requires you to implement a secure authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management.

Requirements:
1. Backend:
   - Create User model with fields: name, email, password (hashed), and timestamps
   - Implement registration endpoint (/api/users/register)
   - Implement login endpoint (/api/users/login)
   - Implement protected route middleware
   - Add password hashing using bcrypt
   - Implement JWT token generation and verification

2. Frontend:
   - Create registration form with validation
   - Create login form with validation
   - Implement authentication context for state management
   - Add protected routes
   - Store JWT in HTTP-only cookies

3. Security:
   - Implement input validation
   - Hash passwords before storing
   - Set secure, HTTP-only cookies for JWT
   - Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
   - Implement proper error handling

4. Testing:
   - Write comprehensive tests for all endpoints
   - Test error cases (invalid credentials, missing fields, etc.)
   - Test protected routes
   - Test token expiration and refresh
