Project Puzzle — Repository Overview
===================================

This repository is a structured MERN skeleton designed for task-based work. The
backend, frontend, utilities, and individual tasks are kept deliberately tidy so
that each new task can plug into a predictable layout.

Top-level layout
----------------

- backend/
  Node/Express API using MongoDB (Mongoose). Initially wired with placeholder
  logic, then gradually filled in by tasks (for example, Task 001 implements the
  real Task API under /api/tasks).

- frontend/
  React application with a simple routing shell (Home, Tasks, Dashboard). The UI
  starts out with static placeholder content and can be extended by later tasks.

- utilities/
  Miscellaneous helper scripts and tools that are not tied to a single task.

- tasks/
  Self-contained task directories. Each task folder (e.g. task-001) includes its
  own description, tests, and helpers.

- Dockerfile
  Base Docker image wired to run the backend server. It installs backend
  dependencies and starts the Express app on port 5000.

- docker-compose.yaml
  Compose file for local development. It brings up MongoDB and the backend
  container together, exposing the API on http://localhost:5000.

- run_tests.sh
  Thin wrapper that delegates to task-level test runners under tasks/. As more
  tasks are added, this script can be extended to call each one in turn.

- repo_overview.txt
  This document. A lightweight, human-readable overview of how the pieces fit
  together.

Basic workflows
---------------

1. Running the backend directly on your host
   - cd backend
   - npm install
   - npm run dev
   - The API will be available on http://localhost:5000.

2. Running the backend with Docker Compose
   - From the repo root:
     - docker-compose up --build
   - This starts:
     - MongoDB on port 27017
     - The backend API on http://localhost:5000

3. Running tests
   - From the repo root:
     - ./run_tests.sh
   - This script currently forwards to tasks/task-001/run-tests.sh, which in turn
     runs the Node-based tests defined in tasks/task-001/task_tests.js against
     the running backend.

As new tasks are introduced, they should live under tasks/ as their own
subdirectories, each with a task_description.txt, tests, and a small
run-tests.sh entry point. The goal is to keep the project easy to navigate and
friendly to both humans and automation.
